# jsimplefuzzyset
Simple Fuzzy Search Library for Java.

Very simple and extensible library for spell correction or fuzzy search for app/domain specific terms. 
Term score algo is pluggable and domain specific algorithms can be applied, instead of default algorithm.


If number of terms are huge or if app requires great performance, 
this may not be useful at all and Lucene, Sphinx kind of real search libraries could be used for that.
